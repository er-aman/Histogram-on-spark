You are asked to re-implement Project #1 (Histogram clustering) using Spark and Scala. 
An empty project4/src/main/scala/Histogram.scala is provided, as well as scripts to build and run this code on Comet. 
You should modify Histogram.scala only. Your main program should take one argument: the text file that contains the pixels (pixels-small.txt or pixels-large.txt). 
The resulting histograms must be written to the output. Note that you do not need to define a Color class. 
You can just use a pair of two integers, one for the color type and one for the color intensity.

You can compile Histogram.scala using:

run histogram.build
and you can run it in local mode over the small file using:
sbatch histogram.local.run
You should modify and run your programs in local mode until you get the correct result. 
Your output results must be the same as the solution-small.txt but doesn't have to be in the same order. 
After you make sure that your program runs correctly in local mode, you run it in distributed mode using:
sbatch histogram.distr.run
This will work on the moderate-sized file and will print the results to the output. 
Your output results must be the same as the solution-large.txt but doesn't have to be in the same order.
